Share-Your-Ride
===============

A Django-based web application built during HP Hackathon.

This application uses the Google Maps API and helps people find other people to car pool with based on their travel routes and time of travel.

There are two kinds of participants: 
1. People who use their own cars for travelling but are open to pooling with other people. These users are given the option to feed their travel route and time of travel into the app using Google Maps. 
2. People who'd like to pool with other travellers provided their start and end locations fall in the travellers route.

These users have the option of providind their start and end location along with a radius which captures the distance that they are willing to go from the start and end position to find a ride.
